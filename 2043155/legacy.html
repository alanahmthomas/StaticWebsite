        <p>Betrayed by his own nation, criminal charges were done against him under the Homosexual act in 1952. He was trialed and declared guilty, sentencing him to either imprisonment or chemical castration. </p>

        <p class="newspaper">“The anti-gay laws remained on the statute book under the heading ‘Unnatural Offences.’ As with the ‘gross indecency’ law, the ban on ‘buggery’, which was legislated in 1533 during the reign of King Henry VIII, was not repealed until 2003. This was the year the criminalisation of homosexuality finally ended in England and Wales.Turing was found guilty on three counts of “gross indecency contrary to Section II of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885”—a law that had its first sensational effect in the trial of Oscar Wilde. Turing had not contested the charges—he gave an explicitly detailed admission of them.”</p>
        <p>Turing decided to face the chemical castration which, back in that day it was used to ‘cure’ him of homosexuality and was refused to work for any government services again.</p>

        <p>Sadly, today we are still unaware if he was poisoned from cynaide or he did commit suicide, but a man truly ahead of his time sadly passed away on the 7<sup>th</sup> of June, 1954, 16 days before his 42<sup>nd</sup> birthday.</p>
