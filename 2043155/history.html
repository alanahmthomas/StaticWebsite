    <p>The universal computing machine developed by Alan Turing was later built for modern computing which has completely transformed the world we live in from the day it was made until forever. World War II began in 1939, where we were at war with the Germans. The Enigma Code, which produced encoded messages were sent by electrical signals and was used in the war in order to finally break it, which was done so by Alan Turing and his team.</p>

    <h2>What is Enigma?</h2>
    <p>Enigma is a code-generating machine that was developed in 1918, by a German scientist named Arthur Scherbius. The enigma was not in fact tested and ready for use until 1923, a lot of commercial models were made during its time of development however, the German military wanted even stronger cryptography which encouraged everyone to work harder and to be ready to use when needed thus, the scientist worked even harder towards a military-only version of the Enigma that was incredibly powerful. Similar to a cash register, the enigma machine were mechanical devices with twenty-six keys, the alphabet and three internal wheels. </p>

    <h3><a href="https://ww-2.com/blog/working-of-enigma-machine/">Check here to see how the Enigma machine worked!</a></h3>

    <h2>Bletchley Park, 1939</h2>
    <p>Turing using his knowledge in cryptography to break German naval codes, he was hired for a full-time job in Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire during the second World War in 1939. Known as Britain’s codebreaking center, Bletchley Park produced ultra-intelligence. German cyphers were accelerated, the Polish bomba technique was improved, and an electromechanical device that could find settings for the Enigma machine was developed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The worst part of protecting the Enigma machine involved Alan’s team to not tell a soul what the Germans had planned. By cracking the Enigma, they knew the Germans every move however, if they were to tell our army the Germans would realise and all their work would have been ruined. Germany were convinced absolutely no one could ever break the Enigma, they thought wrong! Once Turing cracked the Enigma, the secret of breaking Enigma was hidden for over 30 years due to Government policy. </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Historians estimate that breaking enigma shortened the war by more than two years, saving over 14 million lives!</h4>
    <br>
    <h2>Post-War</h2>
    <p>Post-war, due to finishing his job for the Government as he was not needed anymore, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine - presenting a paper on the 19<sup>th</sup> of February, 1945 discussing the first design of a stored-program computer. Turing then joined University of Manchester in 1949 as a deputy director of the computing laboratory. Releasing a paper in 1950, discussing artificial intelligence for the first time. </p>
